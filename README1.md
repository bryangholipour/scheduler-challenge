## User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar✅
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours✅
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future✅
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event✅
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage❌
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist❌

This was a deceptively difficult project that although involved taking bootstrap templates as opposed to building from scratch, still ended up giving me a tough time. I've realized that trying to completely emulate an app/ page is kind of like trying to mimic someones handwriting- very tricky if not close to impossible. I did however enjoy tinkering with all the different things that bootstrap can do with a page. Unfortunately, I spent way too much time being stuck on the design elements as well as getting my accurate time/date to work with moment.js, I ran out of time to complete the rest of the assignment: the local storage as well as getting the color blocks to correlate with the current time.
